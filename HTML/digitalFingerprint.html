			<h2> ENVIRONMENTAL DIGITAL FOOTPRINT: </h2>
			<section id=sectionEstimation class="section">
				
				<span>ESTIMATION</span>
				<p>Estimating environmental digital footprint of the UIT of Montreuil is not easy! <br/> Hereunder, we have tried to estimate it as
					well and as accurately as possible. <br/> This estimation gives an idea of the UIT digital footprint:</p>

				<figure id="fig0-1">
					<a href="" ><img src="../IMG/projector2.png" alt="projector2" id="projector2"/></a>
				</figure>

				<figure>The video projectors consumption:</figure>

				<p>There are around 50 video projectors, one in each class at around 50W/H of consummation for each of them. <br/> They are
				on from 9 am to 4.40 pm, so around 7 hours a day, and this for 20 days per month. <br/> We have divided the consummation
				by 4 because, in average, they are only used in one quarter of the rooms.</p>

				<p> That makes (50x50x7) x 20/4 = 15 000 W/h = 15 kW/h, equivalent in euros according to the kW/h price in France: 2,25 euros. </p>
				
				<figure id="fig0-2">
					<a href=""><img src="../IMG/computer.png" alt="computer"/></a>
				</figure>
				
				<figure>The computer consumption:</figure>

				<p> There are around 730 computers in the UIT. <br/> 565 of them are used for pedagogic purpose, at around 100W/h each one in
				normal using, knowing that around the quarter are in standby and the others (around 550) are on from 9 am to 5.30 pm
				(8,5 h) and this 20 days per month. </p>
				<p>That makes (100 x 550 x 8,5) x 20 = 9 350 000W/h = 9 350kW/h, equivalent in euros according the k>/h price in France: 1402,5 euros.</p>
				<p>According to EDF, driving with a smart electric all the time during several months is equivalent as the computer consumption.</p>

				<figure> The rooms with lighting consumption:</figure>
				<p> There are around 100 rooms with lighting in the UIT. <br/> For each one, it is 270 W consumption, counting 9 LED panels
				per rooms. </p>

				<p> That makes 9x15W/h=270W/h of consumption from 8 am. to 7 pm. <br/> Knowing that the rooms are lit only half of the time, we divide the consumption per 2. </p>

				<p>That is (270X100X11) X 20 /2 = 5940KW/h, equivalent in euros according to the French KW/h price: 891 euros.</p>

				<figure>The lecture hall consumption:</figure>

				<p>We have counted around 500W of lighting multiplied per 2, because there are only two large lecture halls in the UIT.</p>
				<p>That makes (500 X 2) x 20 = 20 000W/h, equivalent in euros according to the KW: h price in French : 3 euros.</p>
				<p>1000W = 1KW/h = 15 cents.</p>

				<span>A SET OF SUGGESTIONS TO REDUCE THE OVERALL IMPACT:</span>
				
				<p> According to ADEME, the French Ecological Transition Agency, digital pollution represents 4% of greenhouse gases in
				the world, due to the extraction of metals, material production, material transport, products chemicals used, Internet
				consumption etc. </p>
				<p>To reduce the overall impact of the digital footprint from the UIT, several suggestions are possible, at several levels and for all stakeholders, students and staff of the UIT:</p>
				<figure>About Materials:</figure>
				
					<figure id="fig1">
						<a href=""><img src="../IMG/reparation.png" alt="reparation" id="reparation"/></a>
						<a href=""><img src="../IMG/projector.png" alt="projector" id="projector"/></a>
						<a href=""><img src="../IMG/blue_angel.png" alt="blue_angel" id="blue_angel"/></a>
					</figure>
				<ul id="ul1">

					<li>Buy electronic equipment manufactured from recycled materials, or refurbished devices</li>
					<li>Buy components that last longer to avoid buying too much often.</li>
					<li>Repair the equipment rather than changing it event sometimes it is cheaper to change it.</li>
					<li>Reduce the number of physical screens by replacing them with screens projected by LED projectors or sunglasses virtual reality.</li>
					<li>Improve the recycling of end-of life digital devices.</li>
					<li>Favour environmental labels when purchasing devices, such as the « Blue Angel » label created in Germany and including one of the objectives, which is to take into account the end-of-life of the Computer equipment but also its technical characteristics: recycling of materials, reduction of energy consumption, chemical emissions pollution and noise.</li>

				</ul>

				<figure>About Messaging mails:</figure>

				<ul>
					<li> Write fewer emails and delete all unnecessary emails consumers of energy. </li>
					<li>Sort out your emails, by deleting spams.</li>
					<li>Unsubscribe from newsletters from unnecessary sites.</li>
					<li>Have light email signatures without for example, pictures.</li>
					<li>Reduce the texts in emails and the number of recipients to whom we send emails.</li>
					<li>Send the link of photos, images, or documents rather than attachments of these same elements.</li>
					<li>Put your computer to sleep for long of time without use.</li>
					<li>Turn off the box and the UIT servers when they are out of use (especially during the holidays).</li>
				</ul>

				<figure>About Internet:</figure>
				
				<figure id="fig2">
					<a href=""><img src="../IMG/bin.png" alt="bin" id="bin"/></a>
				</figure>

				<ul id="ul2">
					<li>Optimize data storage (accumulator) and regularly delete the cache of the applications used (browser).</li>
					<li>Close unused Internet tabs.</li>
					<li>Take the time to properly formulate your requests to limit the research.</li>
					<li>Add the most visited sites to favourite, to avoid having to resort to queries in the search bar and thus avoid the browser to use database to do so.</li>
					<li>Remove unused software.</li>
					<li>Organize folders, subfolders, and Clouds, for quick consultation.</li>
					<li>Empty your recycle bin and download folder and set up rules for automatic emptying of the mail trash.</li>
					<li>Reduce your browsing time. These suggestions are also valid for smartphones.</li>
				</ul>

				<figure>About Office:</figure>

				<ul>
					<li>Activate the « Energy Saving » mode, in the power settings.</li>
					<li>Transmit files digitally without necessarily printing them.</li>
					<li>If printing optimize them: make the right number of copies.</li>
					<li>Print in black and white, on both sides.</li>
					<li>Limit the use of post-it notes, paper calendars, pockets or shirts, etc.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>To raise awareness of these actions, the UIT can set up campaigns information on the importance of these responsible behaviours, organize cleaning days, as many companies and establishments do, set up working groups to carry out actions targeted, etc.</p>
				<p>These digital pollution reduction actions must be added to procedures also for waste management, anti-food waste of supplies, control of the establishment’s carbon footprint, a policy in terms of transport, etc.</p>

				<figure id="fig3">
					<a href="" ><img src="../IMG/greenKey.png" alt="greenKey" id="greenKey"/></a>
				</figure>

				<p>It is in fact a set of actions, a « whole », which must be implemented to reduce the overall impact of digital technology and accelerate the ecological transition.</p>

				<span>ONE EXAMPLE OF AN ESTABLISHMENT WHICH IS COMMITTED TO REDUCE ITS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT:</span>

				<p>Polytech Montpellier</p>

				<figure id="fig4">
					<a href="" ><img src="../IMG/polytech.png" alt="polytech" id="polytech"/></a>
				</figure>

				<p>In 2021, POLYTECH Montpellier, located in the South of France, was awarded the « Campus Responsible », initiated by ADEME, the Ecological Transition Agency.</p>
				<p>The establishment also obtained an antifood waste prize in the competition Ecotrophélia France in 2019 and was labelled “Sustainable Development and Social Responsibility”.</p>
				<p>This establishment has implemented a social responsibility approach with its engineering students and carried out 115 actions over the year 2021. Hereunder are a few examples of these actions:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Training modules have been created, especially during evening debates around films or conferences.</li>
					<li>This establishment has calculated its carbon footprint and updates it regularly, to educate students and staff, for example, electricity consumption is displayed in real time in the reception hall.</li>
					<li>Waste management has been put in place, etc.</li>
				</ul>
